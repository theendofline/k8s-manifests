**This YAML configuration represents a `ReplicaSet` object in Kubernetes.** 
A ReplicaSet is used to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. Here's a breakdown of the key components in this configuration:

- **API Version and Kind:** Indicates the API version (`apps/v1`) and the kind of Kubernetes object (`ReplicaSet`).

- **Metadata:** Provides metadata about the ReplicaSet, including annotations, creation timestamp, labels, and names. The annotations include resource adjustments made by `autopilot.gke.io` and other deployment-related metadata.

- **Spec (Specification):**

   - `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of replicas (pods) to run.
   - `selector`: Defines how to identify pods that belong to this ReplicaSet, using `matchLabels`.
   - `template`: Describes the pod template that the ReplicaSet uses to create new pods. This includes:
      - Pod Metadata: Labels to apply to the pods.
      - Pod Spec (Specification): Details of the pod, such as container image (`nginx:latest`), resource requests and limits, security settings, etc.
  - Status: Provides the current status of the ReplicaSet, including the number of replicas that are available, labeled, ready, and the total number of replicas.
 
  This example is from the [GKE Autopilot cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview) configuration.
